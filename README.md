## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> My name is Ian. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience on IT projects. I'm currently interested in low-level programming paradigms and high performance computing.

I've 244 public and private projects in GitHub since 2014, all of them are ideas, forks, scaffoldings and backups. None of them is relevant but describes a learning path.

I like states, economy and industries (I'm student of Civil Industrial Engineer too). I'm good with numbers, metrics, charts, composed-variables but i prefer to work with code as is less speculative and more reflexive.

If you're interested in my profile, send me a email to iantorres@outlook.com

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> My name is Ian. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with at least 10 years of experience on IT projects. I'm currently interested in low-level programming paradigms and high performance computing.

I've +500 public and private projects (including orgs projects) in GitHub since 2014, all of them are ideas, forks, scaffoldings and backups. None of them is relevant but describes a learning path.

I like states, economy and industries (I'm student of Civil Industrial Engineer too). I'm good with numbers, metrics, charts, composed-variables but i prefer to work with code as is less speculative and more reflexive. Of course, the music moves me forward.

I'm currently working on a personal/private project, doing a unique per-day minimun effort from monday to sunday, to build a rock solid platform using controllers, queues, jobs, broadcasting, multithreading and so on, in a low level context using well designed, optimized and clean code, in other words, zen code.

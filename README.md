## Hi there 👋

I'm Ian — a Computer Science Engineer and Civil Industrial Engineer with 12+ years of experience building software systems end-to-end. My focus has always been on **high-performance coding**, **clean architectures**, and **well-designed systems** that scale without becoming a mess.

Since 2014 I've accumulated 500+ GitHub projects (public + private, including org work). Most are experiments, prototypes, forks, scaffolds, or backups — not “showcase” projects — but together they reflect my learning path, thinking style, and technical breadth.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **technology, economics, states and industries**. I'm comfortable with numbers, metrics, composed variables and analytical decision-making, but I prefer code: it's less speculative, more exact, more honest.

I'm currently focused on a long-term private project, working daily (Mon–Sun) to build a **rock-solid platform** with optimized, clean, and intentional code — what I call *zen code*. I’ve logged over **10K hours** working solo since 2009, but I've also collaborated with small and large teams professionally since 2012.

I hold certifications in Project Management, Agile Methodologies, Cybersecurity, Troubleshooting, AI, Data Science, Accounting, and Laravel — useful tools, but ultimately just skills.

## Hi there 👋

> My name is Ian. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with at least 12 years of experience on IT projects. I'm currently interested in low-level programming paradigms and high performance computing.

I've +500 public and private projects (including orgs projects) in GitHub since 2014, almost all of them are ideas, forks, scaffoldings and backups. None are relevant but it describes skills, learning paths and more.

I like States, Economies and Industries (I'm Civil Industrial Engineer too...). I'm good with numbers, metrics, charts, composed-variables but prefer work in code as is less speculative and more reflexive.

> I'm currently working on a personal/private project, doing every day efforts from monday to sunday, to build a rock solid platform using well designed, optimized and clean code, in other words, zen code, also, i'm not a easy person as i've got more than 10K hours working alone in code since 2009 but i have a lot of work experience, since 2012, collaborating with small and big teams.

I've certification in Project Management, Agile Methodologies, Cybersecurity, Throubleshooting, AI, Data Science, Accounting and Laravel. IMHO, are just skills.
